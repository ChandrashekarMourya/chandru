1.	Let – is a variable declares locally.
        - Scope of this is within a block only.
Example : 
function DisplayName(){
	let name = “Chandru”;
	console.log(name);	// returns Chandru
	if(name == “Chandru”){
let name = “Reeshma”;
console.log(name);	  // returns Reeshma
	}
	console.log(name); 	// returns Chandru
}

2.	This – It refers to an object it belongs to current execution context.
- this keyword acts as a global object (default).
-	When there is an object property which are calling as a method then that object becomes this object.

Example: 
function bike(){
	console.log(this.name);
}
var name = “Ninja”;
var obj = { name: “Pulsar” };

bike();		// “Ninja”
bike.call(obj);	// “Pulsar”

a. let is to declare a variable whereas this is to get / set the object variable.
